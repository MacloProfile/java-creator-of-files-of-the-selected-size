## What the program does?
The program creates a file of a certain size (b, kb, mb, gb) and saves it to the path specified by the user. You only need to specify the size, units, path, file name and extension (optional). 

These files are convenient to use when combining several files into one using special programs, or for example via a self-extracting archive (SFX-archive).

## Features 
- SIZE - file size
- PATH - the path where the program creates the file (not required, by default files are saved in C:\\\)
- SIZE UNITS - units of measurement
- NAME - file name (optional, by default the file name is file + random number)

## Important
Version java 17 and higher!</br>
If you get "File ERROR" error, try to select another folder (or create a new one and select it). Often this error is caused by the fact that the application does not have enough permissions to create a file.
